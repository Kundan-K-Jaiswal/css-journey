# CSS Journey 🚀

Welcome to my **CSS Journey** — a collection of small, focused web projects I created while learning HTML and CSS. This repo showcases everything from layout experiments to fun animations, organized into self-contained folders. Each project helps me better understand modern web design concepts.
<li>It Contains a Navigation Page Through Which you can launch the `index.html` file of each folder in your browser.</li>

## 📁 Folder Structure

Each folder represents a separate project. Here's what's inside:
