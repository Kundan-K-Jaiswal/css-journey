# 👨‍🏫 Responsive Web Page

In this folder, I have applied 'Media Queries' for my page. Here, I have tried to keep the text inside my div in a single line through reducing the size also I have changed the background to various colors inorder to make changes visible for us.

Also I have added a responsive navbar, I simply copied the navbar layout from "creating-navbar" file & then I used "media queries" to make it responsive.
