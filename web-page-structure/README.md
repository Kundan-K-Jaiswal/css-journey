# üßë‚Äçüíª Web Page Sturcture

This folder shows the visual representation of a web page structure, here in this folder I have tried to achieve the basic web page structure of any page using html and css. Also I have added a fixed button which is not actually a button which doesnot move on the screen while scrolling. I was able to achieve this with the help of position property from CSS.
